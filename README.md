# darkvoid

Have you ever been in a dark room, coding alone, surrounded by silence and the soft glow of your screen? That deep immersion, like a vast, quiet void, was the inspiration behind **darkvoid-theme**: an experience as profound as exploring an uncharted deep-sea trench lit only by strange, glowing creatures, or wandering through a cave where luminescent fungi paint the darkness... _Aah, the scenery!_

**darkvoid** captures that atmosphere, emphasizing only the essentials—your code, your commands—leaving distractions in shadow.
